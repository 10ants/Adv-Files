-----------------Record boundary
int size of record
int identifier of what kind of object follows
int size of data block
Byte version of an object - See Unserialize in correct object to get byte buffer
-----------------Record boundary

So third record would be to read an int, move forward that far, read an int, move again
Third Person would be same, except you'd also read the second int to see if it was a Person
